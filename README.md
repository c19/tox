This library is an implementation of [toxcore][toxcore] in [Rust] - P2P,
distributed, encrypted, easy to use DHT-based network.

## Reference

[The Tox Reference](https://zetok.github.io/tox-spec) should be used for
implementing toxcore in Rust. [Reference source repository].

If existing documentation appears to not be complete, or is not clear enough,
issue / pull request should be filled on the reference repository.

## Contributions

...are welcome. :smile: For details, look at
[CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Building
Fairly simple. First, install [Rust] >= 1.56.1 and a C compiler ([Build Tools
for Visual Studio][VSBuild] on Windows, GCC or Clang on other platforms).

Then you can build the debug version with

```bash
cargo build
```

To run tests, use:

```bash
cargo test
```

To build docs and open them in your browser:

```bash
cargo doc --open
```

## Cross build using Docker
```
./scripts/build.sh
```

### With clippy
To check for [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy) warnings
(linting), you need nightly Rust with `clippy-preview` component.

To check:

```bash
cargo clippy --all
```

To check with tests:

```bash
cargo clippy --all --tests
```


## Goals
 - improved toxcore implementation in Rust
 - Rust API
 - documentation
 - tests
 - more

## Progress

A fully working tox-node written in pure Rust with a DHT server and a TCP relay
can be found [here](https://github.com/tox-rs/tox-node).

Right now we are working on the client part.
